A sleek, feature-rich, and interactive Pok√©dex web application built with modern web technologies. This isn't just a data viewer; it's a complete Pok√©mon experience with a detailed data browser and an engaging "Who's That Pok√©mon?" mini-game. This project is built as a single-page static application, perfect for demonstrating strong front-end development skills.
